name = QgsWcsClient2
qgisMinimumVersion = 3.0
description = A OGC WCS 2.0/EO-WCS Client; a tool to download (and subset in space and time) a time-series of raster data.
version = version 0.3.2

category = Web
author = Christian Schiller at EOX IT Services GmbH, Vienna, Austria
email = christian.schiller@eox.at

about = The WCS 2.0/EO-WCS Client allows to specify an Area-Of-Interest and a Time-Of-Interest and then access/download the raster data (coverages) from OGC WCS-2.0 and WCS-2.0/EO-WCS compliant servers.
   Unlike WMS, WCS enables the access to the original data (and not just to portrayals).
   The tool also handles the EO-WCS Application profile which allows to access/download a full time-series of coverages with just a few clicks.
   For multi-band EO-imagery the bands of interest can also be selected/sub-setted and their order in the output can be chosen.
   The downloaded coverages are directly loaded as layers into QGIS.
   Requirements: This tool requires the python lxml-module to be pre-installed.
